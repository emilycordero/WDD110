    <h2>Emily Cordero</h2>
    
    <p>I am a wife and mother to a one year old. I currently live in Washington and I work full time as a WIC certifier in a local clinic. Here are some images of my family.</p>
    <img class='image' alt="Image of my daughter" src="images/mydaughter.jpg"> 
    <img class='image' alt="Image of my husband and I" src="images/myhusbandandme.jpg"> 
    <img class='image' alt="Image of my daughter and my husband" src="images/mydaughterandhusband.jpg"> 
    <p> Some things that I love to do are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Eating Hispanic meals.</li>
        <li>Spending time with my family.</li>
        <li>Building basic python programs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am interested in getting a bachelors degree in Software Development. I absolutely love that BYU includes the scripture. I am not a member of the Church but I like the things that are taught here.</p>
    <p>I am a first generation university student and I work very hard to help provide for my family. My husband has his own business and encouraged me to follow my passion in Computer Science. So here I am. Thank you for reading my little page. </p>
