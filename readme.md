Developing a site plan is a critical step in any web design process. Site plans help establish the purpose of the site, the voice, and overall look and feel, and then they help you apply those consistently across your site.

Site plans come in many shapes and sizes and in varying levels of detail. Here is a list of common elements in a site plan:

Statement of purpose and goals
Definition of audience
Personas and scenarios (Who will use the site and how will they use it?)
A style guide:
Branding information (how to use the branding for the site correctly)
Typography choices and justification
Color palette
Specific styling of elements on the site (headings, lists, paragraphs, forms, links, buttons, and so on)
A site map
Wireframes showing general layout and content for major pages
We will be making a simplified site plan for our web site. Ours will focus on the sections for purpose, audience and a partial style guide. Since the style guide will be the largest portion, let's take a look at an example to get a better idea about how site plan might be put together.
